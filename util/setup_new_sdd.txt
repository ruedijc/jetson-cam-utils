# Basic instructions for adding a new mSATA ssd to the CTI spacely carrier with tx2/tx2i on L4T -
#
# Attach the drive. reboot
#
# Show the disks on the system 

fdisk -l

# probably new disk will be something like /dev/sda

#create a partition on the new disk

fdisk /dev/sda

# select "n - create a partition"
# select primary partition, "p"
# give partition number, default value 1
# first sector, use default
# last sector, use default
# save changes and exit, w

# Now format the disk with mkfs command. (/dev/sda plus a 1 for first partition)

mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda1

# make a dir where you want the drive to be located
mkdir /media/msata

#Once formatting has been completed, now mount the partition to "/media/msata" for example

mount /dev/sda1 /media/msata

# to make it permanent, make an entry in /etc/fstab file:
# the last two values are dump=0, pass=2 (for example)
# the pass indicates the order of checking on boot. root fs should be 1
# other disks, values  higher
/dev/sda1	/media/msata	ext4	defaults     0   2

# the end
