This folder contains planned tasks and config files

tasks that output to queue are generally one-shot initiated tasks that we want to see the result soon.
tasks that output to other locations, generate more data for review upon return to ground

---- one-shot sequence tasks ---------------------------------------------------
task1 - LED calibration sequence, one-shot, outputs to queue
task2 - HSI and Context camera sequence, one-shot, outputs to queue
---- tasks for use by services and repeating timers (first part of mission) -----
task3 - LED calibration sequence, for timer/service, outputs to task3
task4 - HSI and Context camera sequence, for timer/service, outputs to task4
---- one-shot sequence tasks ---------------------------------------------------
task5 - take short HSI camera video (TIF sequence), one-shot, outputs to queue
task6 - take short Context camera video (h265), one-shot, outputs to queue
task7 - take a longer HSI camera video (TIF sequence), one-shot, outputs to vid
task8 - take a longer Context camera video (h265), one-shot, outputs to vid
---- tasks for use by services and repeating timers (last part of mission) -----
task9 - LED calibration sequence, for timer/service, outputs to task9
task10 - HSI and Context camera sequence, for timer/service, outputs to task10
---- utility tasks ---------------------------------------------------
task11 - clear the on-board queue folder (delete files currently in the queue folder)
task12 - perform on-board hyperspectral reconstruction, TBD
task13 - stop all tasks, return to default state
task14 - prepare for powerloss
task15 - copy newest files into queue, TBD


For deployment - 
copy ./* into ~/tasks/
copy ./hsi_config/* into /etc/hsi-config/
copy ./*.service into /etc/systemd/system/
copy ./*.timer into /etc/systemd/system/
