Dependencies:

1. GTK+-2
Ubuntu/Debian: sudo apt-get install libgtk2.0-dev
OS X/Macports: sudo port install gtk2 gtk-engines2
              (add "+quartz -x11" to /opt/local/etc/macports/variants.conf before that)

2. a. GStreamer-0.10
Ubuntu/Debian: sudo apt-get install libgstreamer-plugins-base0.10-dev gstreamer0.10-x
OS X/Macports: sudo port install gstreamer010-gst-plugins-good

or b. GStreamer-1.0 (build with "make GST10=1" command to choose this option)
Ubuntu/Debian: sudo apt-get install libgstreamer-plugins-base1.0-dev gstreamer1.0-x
OS X/Macports: sudo port install gstreamer1-gst-plugins-good


Notes:

Both GStreamer variants are supported because on some systems only one of them is available or works properly.
For example GStreamer-0.10 is absent from Linux For Tegra, so please use GStreamer-1.0 version there.
